**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing COVID data to gain insights into the spread and impact of the virus on different regions and populations. It involves processing and visualizing data related to cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population demographics to understand the trends and patterns of the pandemic.

I've created a dynamic and informative Tableau dashboard utilizing the insights extracted from our COVID-19 data analysis. This dashboard offers a visually engaging representation of key findings, allowing stakeholders to gain valuable insights into the spread and impact of the pandemic.

**Technologies Used:**

**Database Management System**: SQL Server is utilized for storing and managing the COVID-19 datasets, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.

**SQL**: SQL queries are employed for data extraction, transformation, and analysis from the underlying COVID-19 datasets.

**Tableau:** Tableau Desktop is used for creating the dashboard and visualizing the extracted findings in an interactive and engaging manner.
